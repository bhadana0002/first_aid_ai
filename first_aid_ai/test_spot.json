  "response": "This sounds like a common injury. Since the cut is on the forehead, it might bleed more than expected. We need to ensure it is clean and covered.\n\n### **Immediate Assessment & Safety Warning**\n\nPlease quickly check for the following critical signs. If you see any of these, **immediately Call Emergency Services (112 or local ambulance)** and alert the school nurse/administration:\n\n*   The cut is wide or very deep (gaping open).\n*   The bleeding is heavy and does not stop after 5 minutes of firm pressure.\n*   The wound has dirt, gravel, or a foreign object (like glass) stuck inside that cannot be rinsed out.\n\n### **First Aid for a Minor Cut on the Forehead**\n\nIf the cut is minor (a scrape or small clean cut), follow these steps strictly:\n\n1.  **Wash Your Hands:** Ensure your hands are thoroughly washed with soap and water before you touch the student or the wound.\n2.  **Apply Gentle Pressure:** If the cut is actively bleeding, use a clean cloth or sterile gauze to apply gentle but firm pressure for a few minutes until the bleeding slows or stops.\n3.  **Clean the Wound:** Gently clean the wound using clean running water or an antiseptic wipe to remove any debris or dirt.\n4.  **Pat Dry:** Pat the area around the wound dry with a clean tissue or gauze. **Do not rub** the wound.\n5.  **Dress the Wound:** Apply a sterile adhesive dressing (plaster) or a clean bandage to protect the area from infection.\n\n### **Recovery and Care Advice**\n\n**Practical Health Tips:**\n\n*   **Monitor for Infection:** Keep an eye on the wound over the next few days. Signs of infection include increasing redness, swelling, warmth, pain, or discharge (pus). If these occur, see a doctor or the school nurse immediately.\n*   **Keep it Dry:** Try to keep the plaster/dressing dry for the first 24 hours. Change the dressing if it becomes wet or dirty.\n\n**Over-the-Counter Suggestions (Consult School Nurse or Doctor):**\n\n*   **Antiseptic Ointment:** A small amount of a simple antiseptic cream (like Povidone-iodine or Neosporin type) can be applied to the cut *before* applying the dressing to help prevent infection.\n*   **Pain Relief:** If the cut is throbbing or painful, standard OTC pain relievers (Paracetamol/Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen) can be used, following proper dosage guidelines and only if advised by a medical professional.\n\n***\n\n[SPOT_ID: 2]\n[PROCEDURE: Wash hands, Apply pressure if bleeding, Clean wound, Pat dry, Apply plaster]"
